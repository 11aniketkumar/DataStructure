divide the function into multiple parts

also return list of all boards instead of printing them directly

also reduce the parameters by creating a helper method that calls the nQueen method
all the redunt parameters can be initialised here and passed implicitly

your approach follows the best possible way thus creating few extra arrays, so its 
obvious to get more parameters, also try doing without this optimized approach to 
practice traversing in this grid
